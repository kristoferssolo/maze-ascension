# Maze Ascension: The Labyrinth of Echoes

"Maze Ascension: The Labyrinth of Echoes" is a minimalist maze exploration
game built using the Bevy engine. The game features simple visuals with
hexagonal tiles forming the maze structure on a white background with black
borders, and a stickman-style player character. Players navigate through
multiple levels of increasing difficulty, progressing vertically as they
climb up through levels. The game includes power-ups and abilities hidden
throughout the maze, and later introduces the ability to move between levels
freely. This unique blend of puzzle-solving, exploration, and vertical
progression offers a fresh twist on traditional maze gameplay, presented in
an accessible and clean visual style.
